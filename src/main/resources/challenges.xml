            <p>Given a string s, form a shortest palindrome by appending characters at the start of the string. <br />
            Example: abab => babab. abcd => dcbabcd. ananab    => bananab.</p>

        <description> <![CDATA[
            <p>We have an array where each element represents height of a tower. If it starts raining, what is the amount of water that can be collected between the towers? Assumption is that the width of every tower is 1.
            <br />Example: <br />
            Input  - {1,5,2,3,1,7,2,4}  <br />
            Output - 11 </p>

            <p>In an array having positive integers, except for one number which occurs odd number of times, all other numbers occur even number of times. Find the number.
            <br />
            Example -
            <br />
            Input : 2 5 9 1 5 1 8 2 8
            <br />
            Output: 9
            <br />
            Input : 2 3 4 3 1 4 5 1 4 2 5

        <description><![CDATA[
					<p>Given a dictionary of words, find minimum number of trials to reach from source word to destination word. A valid trial on word 'w' is defined as either insert, delete or substitute operation of a single character in word 'w' which results in a word 'w1' which is also present in the given dictionary. For example, for dictionary {"BCCI","AICC","ICC","CCI","MCC","MCA", "ACC"}, minimum number of trials to reach from word "AICC" to "ICC" is 1. Only 1 opeartion of deleting character 'A' is required to reach from word "AICC" to word "ICC". Minimum number of trials to reach from "AICC" to "MCC" is 2(AICC->ICC->MCC) and minimum number of trials to reach from "AICC" to "MCA" is 3(AICC->ICC->MCC->MCA). <br><br>Now if you notice, there are no valid trials with source as "AICC" and destination as "BCCI" for above dictionary. Hence the output returned by program should be '-1' indicating destination word cannot be reached from source word.</p>
